"""PawPal+ logic layer.

This module holds all the backend classes for PawPal+:
Task, Pet, Owner, and Scheduler. The Streamlit UI (app.py)
will import and use these classes.

Data ownership (how the pieces relate):
    Owner  has many  Pet
    Pet    has many  Task
    Scheduler reads tasks THROUGH the Owner (owner.get_all_tasks()),
    so it never reaches into a Pet directly.
